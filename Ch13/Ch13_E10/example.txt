The reason why there are 28s between events
in HMI and not 30s is, 
that we are emptying until the level fell below SLS3 for 2s (see atached screenshot). 
After that we are filling and flling event is generated. 
But the time for warning begins to count after the liquid is underneath SLS3 (allready 2s while emptying). 
Thats why you see 28s differen between filling event and warning.
