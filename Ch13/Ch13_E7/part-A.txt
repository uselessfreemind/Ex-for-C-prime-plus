You need to "Enable Thunderbolt Boot Support". 
You can find this setting under System Configuration > USB/Thunderbolt Configuration. If you want to UEFI PXE boot, then you also need to "Enable UEFI Network Stack". 
This setting can be found under General > Advanced Boot Options (disable the "Enable Legacy Option ROMs" while there if you want native UEFI). 
After you do this, then you should see "USB NIC(IPV4)" and "USB NIC(IPV6)" under UEFI BOOT when you press F12 and the USB-C Ethernet adapter is plugged in and connected to the network.
